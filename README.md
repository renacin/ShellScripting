# ShellScripting
This folder will document my efforts to learn shell scripting. This exploratory project will utilize the shell language
ZSH as my MacBook comes preinstalled with it. However since ZSH is built ontop of Bash, as well as takes inspiration
similar shell languages, the skills learned here should be applicable to other *nix environments. 

At some point I do hope to branch off into Windows Shell Scripting (if I can call it that); but that will come at a
later date. 

I hope you enjoy my journey learning Shell Scripting.
